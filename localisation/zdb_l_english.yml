 fire_is_spreading_desc:0 "The help we received from the Soviet Union was quite helpful at the time but it could cost us dearly at a later point because we made way for communist influence across Europe. For now the German communists might be on our side but we have to get rid of them sooner or later if we do not want to risk another 1918 Revolution. Seeing the recent developments in France we could try to convince them to help their comrades in France."

Poland would never agree to return the lands of eastern Prussia back to us under normal circumstances. Luckily for us, Poland is looking desperately for an ally but as long as this eyesore remains there can be no genuine cooperation. It is known that Poland has its own ambitions in the Baltics and in Slovakia. Maybe we can come to an agreement that would satisfy both nations."

 gdb_germany.26.a:0 "Let's confirm our claims."
 gdb_germany.27.t:0 "The Polish Response"
 gdb_germany.27.d:0 "Unsurprisingly the Poles question our claims. They wont consider returning Katowice or Poznan. For the sake of peace and mutual cooperation however, they are willing to make a compromise when it comes to the question of Danzig and the surrounding areas."

This would further solidify our claim on the Memelland and theirs on Lithuania and parts of Latvia."
 gdb_germany.28.a:0 "That's a good deal!"
 gdb_germany.28.b:0 "Sorry but that is just not acceptable!"
 gdb_germany.29.t:0 "Negotiations come to a halt"
 gdb_germany.29.d:0 "The negotiations were without success so far. We either have to make more concessions and persuade them of the mutual benefit of returning more of our claims or otherwise we would have to rattle with our sabres and intimitade them which will sour any hope of a good spirited conclusion."
 gdb_germany.29.a:0 "Persuade them!"
 gdb_germany.29.b:0 "Intimidate them!"
 gdb_germany.30.t:0 "The final offer"
 gdb_germany.30.d:0 "After countless days and several heated arguements our diplomats came to a compromise which both sides would agree upon. The State of Posen will be split into Poznan and Gnesen. Germany will regain Danzig and Posen while relinquishing all other claims on Poland. Poland will receive full access and docking rights along the Vistula river. Germany will fully compensate anyone living in the border region who chooses to leave the state. Furthermore they propose a mutual recognition of the 1793 borders. This would further solidify our claim on the Memelland and theirs on Lithuania and parts of Latvia."
 gdb_germany.30.a:0 "Thats a high price tag but its a worthy outcome!"
 gdb_germany.30.b:0 "Still not good enough. That leaves us only one option..."
 gdb_germany.31.t:0 "Negotiations are over"
 gdb_germany.31.d:0 "The Poles did not like our agressive stance and decided to abandon the conference. They want to call our bluff. The concensus among them is that we are not in position of strength. The scars of the civil war still have not healed entirely. If we do not follow through with our threat we will be seen as weak but if we lose the war we will lose everything."

 gdb_germany.34.t:0 "International intervention"
 gdb_germany.34.d:0 "What a failure...Our army was not succesful in securing all key cities in time. The United Kingdom and the Communist Bloc had time to choose a stance and have threatened to join on the side of Poland if we do not stand down and sign a white peace."
 gdb_germany.34.a:0 "We had no choice."
 gdb_germany.35.t:0 "Treaty of Danzig"
 gdb_germany.35.d:0 "After the resolution of the polish corridor question both powers agreed upon further cooperation. Part of this agreement was the restoration of the 1793 border in the baltics before the second partition of Poland. We now have the chance to follow through with those restoration plans.

 gdb_germany.36.t:0 "The baltic response"
 gdb_germany.36.d:0 "Given their desperate and encircled situation between us and the soviet they opted for the lesser evil. Lithuania went along with the restoration of the Commonwealth. Poland did held its promise and returned the Memelland back to us."
 gdb_germany.36.a:0 "Our eastern borders are finally restored!"
 gdb_germany.37.t:0 "The soviet response."
 gdb_germany.37.d:0 "Our actions in the Baltics did not go unnoticed. The Soviet Union exploited the situation, citing the protection of russian citizens from the royalist resurgence."

 gdb_germany.39.a:0 "Easy pickings. Lets see what week two brings."
 gdb_germany.40.t:0 "Results of the second week"
 gdb_germany.40.d:0 "Thanks to our peaceful management of the German-Polish relationsship and the friendly outcome of the Danzig exchange we had a much better position during the talks. Poland does not press any further claims as it trusts our judgement. This enabled us to fully annex Bohemia and Moravia. Therefore we were able to give the rest of slovakia to to Hungary which will bring them much closer to us and will also strengthen their ambitions."
 gdb_germany.40.a:0 "What a wonderful result. A toast to our new friends!"
 gdb_germany.41.t:0 "Results of the second week"
 gdb_germany.41.d:0 "Since we failed to resolve the polish question succesfully or peacefully Poland made further talks horrible. They are constantly threatening to abandon the talks altogether and to involve the international bodies. The only way to achieve our goals would be to give them the remainder of slovakia. This would sour our relations with Hungary however by a great deal. If we do this our chance to influence the balkans will be gone. We would also lose a potential alliance partner."
 gdb_germany.41.a:0 "Those territories are worth more than the entirety of the balkans!"
 gdb_germany.41.b:0 "We need the Hungarians on our side! Forgo our claims in favor of the Hungarian ones!"
 gdb_germany.41.c:0 "Settle for the status quo. No one will get anything!"
 gdb_germany.42.t:0 "The Balkans are once more in motion"
 gdb_germany.42.d:0 "Given the general feeling of change caused by the recent treaties around europe. Our two friends Poland and Hungary have seen the weakness of Romania as chance to press their claims. They see us as backup if anything happens which made them increasingly reckless in their rhetoric during the last weeks. The government of Romania having to deal with internal issues decided to appease the two powers by partially returning land to them."
 gdb_germany.42.a:0 "Good for them."
 gdb_germany.43.t:0 "Soviet invasion of Bessarabia"
 gdb_germany.43.d:0 "Troubling news reach us that the Soviet Union, inspired by recent events decided to get its share and started to invade the border regions of Romania. It looks like they made secred deals with Bulgaria because there are several reports of movements along the border aswell as small skirmishes in Dobrudja."
 gdb_germany.43.a:0 "Thats horrible!"
 gdb_germany.44.t:0 "Hungary mobilizes its troops."
 gdb_germany.44.d:0 "What started as a small daily balcan business has turned into a race against time. The fights along the southern and eastern border have left the hungarian borders undefended. Empowered by recent gains the Hungarian high command decided to intervene and to occupy the remaining claims. It seems like Jingoism spreads like a wildfire..."
 gdb_germany.44.a:0 "Where will this end????"
 gdb_germany.45.t:0 "Third partition of Romania"
 gdb_germany.45.d:0 "Unable to defend Romania from all fronts against this illegal war without a declaration of war it surrendered to Bulgaria, hoping to not fall into the hands of the Soviets entirely."
 gdb_germany.45.a:0 "Who will be the next victim of the Soviet aggression?"
 gdb_germany.46.t:0 "Bulgaria asks for our help"
 gdb_germany.46.d:0 "After the surrender of Romania, Bulgaria annexed the core territories of Romania. The secret agreements between them and the Soviet Union only included Dobrudja. Now the Soviets demand those lands for themselves. Finding some form of unity in this threat, the remaining governments of the Romania and Bulgaria which now call themselves the Balkan-Union have asked us for help. If we do not act now we risk the Soviet Union gaining a dangerous amount of influence in the balkans!"
 gdb_germany.46.a:0 "The Soviets have to be stopped!"
 gdb_germany.46.b:0 "We wont risk another world war because something happens in the balkans..."
 gdb_germany.47.t:0 "Another Balkan Conference"
 gdb_germany.47.d:0 "Given our strong presence and allies on the Balkans we are able to heavily influence the outcome of this conference. The goal is to further unify the region into the Balkan-Union. We should take care of other territorial claims first though."
 gdb_germany.47.a:0 "Lets start with the obvious."
 gdb_germany.48.t:0 "The Breakup of Yugoslavia"
 gdb_germany.48.d:0 "The surrounding powers have agreed to partition parts of Yugoslavia to satisfy their territorial claims. Slovenia will be returned to the Deutscher Bund, Dalmatia will fall into the hands of Italy and the Banat region will once more be part of the Hungarian state."
 gdb_germany.48.a:0 "Excellent"
 gdb_germany.49.t:0 "The completed Union"
 gdb_germany.49.d:0 "After resolving the most pressing issues it is now time for Yugoslavia to join the Balkan-Union."
 gdb_germany.49.a:0 "Hopefully this brings peace to the Balkans."
 gdb_germany.50.t:0 "The final act"
 gdb_germany.50.d:0 "There is one last thing. Italy aswell as the Balkan Union demand from each other to relinquish their remaining claims. The Union views Dalmatia and Albania still a central part of their region but Italy wants those claims gone. In return Italy now demands Montenegro. Altough the Balkan-Union is our ally we should consider taking the side of Italy if we do not want them to feel mutilated again."
 gdb_germany.50.a:0 "Support claims of the Balkan-Union."
 gdb_germany.50.b:0 "Support the claims of Italy."
 gdb_germany.51.t:0 "Unholy Alliance"
 gdb_germany.51.d:0 "Our recent actions have made Italy so desperate that they have reconsidered their stance. Given the overall situation in Europe Mussolini decided that they should work together with the Communists to eleminate the Royalist threat across Europe. This would also bring them much closer to their strategic goal of completing north-east Africa aswell as the Balkan Coastline.
 gdb_germany.51.a:0 "Scheiße."
 gdb_germany.52.t:0 "Mussolini Assassinated"
 gdb_germany.52.d:0 "Soon after the announcement of the italian-soviet partnership lots of former supporters of Mussolini left his side. Some radicals even attempted an assassination attempt which severely injured Mussonlini. The doctors did their best but had to announce his death on the following morning. Il duce è morto."
 gdb_germany.52.a:0 "Thats what you get for dealing with the devil!"
 gdb_germany.53.t:0 "Italian civil war"
 gdb_germany.53.d:0 "Following the turmoil caused by the death of mussolini and the created power vacuum radical communists, supported by french and soviets agents have proclaimed the socialist Italian Union. Fascists elements have centered around Palermo in an attempt to free italy of communist influence."
 gdb_germany.53.a:0 "Nein! Nein! Nein!"
 gdb_germany.54.t:0 "Yugoslavia caves in"
 gdb_germany.54.d:0 "Under the joined pressure of the Deutscher Bund, Hungary and Italy, Yugoslavia agreed to return Slovenia to the Bund, Dalmatia to Italy and the Vojwodina aswell as West-Banat to Hungary."
 gdb_germany.54.a:0 "Ausgezeichnet!"
 gdb_germany.55.t:0 "Italian ambitions"
 gdb_germany.55.d:0 "We received a secret message from Italy who wants to make us an offer. They know that we want to see Istria returned to the Bund. They want to make us an offer. They want to squeeze Yugoslavia even furter, trying to obtain as much of the balkans as they can. If we were to lets say look away they would be willing to give us Istria in exchange. They would of course be granted rights to move their troops through Istria."
 gdb_germany.55.a:0 "No. We dont need more italian influence in the balkans."
 gdb_germany.56.b:0 "That offer sounds fair. We dont have much to lose there anyway."
 gdb_germany.56.t:0 "The end of Yugoslavia"
 gdb_germany.56.d:0 "Today italian and hungarian troops have crossed the borders of former Yugoslavia after the the Yugoslavs were pressured to accept further -protection- from Italy. Bosnia will become a part of Italy while Croatia will be returned to Hungary. The remainder will know once more be known as Serbia which is officially an independent state but de facto nothing more than an italian puppet."
 gdb_germany.56.a:0 "Time for italy to hold its end of the bargain!"
