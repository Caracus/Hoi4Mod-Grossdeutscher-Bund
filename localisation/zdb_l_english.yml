 fire_is_spreading:0 "Pass on the torch"
 fire_is_spreading_desc:0 "The help we received from the Soviet Union was quite helpful at the time but it could cost us dearly at a later point because we made way for communist influence across Europe. For now the German communists might be on our side but we have to get rid of them sooner or later if we do not want to risk another 1918 Revolution. Seeing the recent developments in France we could try to convince them to help their comrades in France."
 ignite_the_spark:0 "Ignite the spark"
 ignite_the_spark_desc:0 "Under the pretense of fleeing from the German Civil War or the possible aftermath many Germans have left the country to either find refuge in the French border region or to support communism in France.

 former_lands:0 "Realpolitik"
 former_lands_desc:0 "We find ourselves in a strong position while the rest of Europe is still engulfed in the flames of revolution.

Our goal shall be the reclaimation of former territories of the once mighty Kaiserreich."
 invite_austria:0 "Accession of Austria"
 invite_austria_desc:0 "Austria has already expressed an interest in joining Germany after the dissolution of the Habsburg monarchy at the end of the first world war. Ever since then there were aspirations to deepen our ties. Austria also played a major role in the first German Confederation."

 former_lands_north:0"The Polish Eyesore"
 former_lands_north_desc:0"Ever since the harsh Treaty of Versailles the map of Germany is tainted by the polish corridor. Poland would never agree to return the lands of eastern Prussia back to us under normal circumstances. Luckily for us, Poland is looking desperately for an ally but as long as this eyesore remains there can be no genuine cooperation. It is known that Poland has its own ambitions in the Baltics and in Slovakia. Maybe we can come to an agreement that would satisfy both nations."

 hold_our_promise:0"Support Polish ambitions"
 hold_our_promise_desc:0"The return of Danzig left Poland without direct access to the sea. The docking rights and access to Vistula river were not enough to satisfy them.

 gdb_germany.6.t:0"The Fate of Belgium"
 gdb_germany.6.d:0"It has become clear that the idea of a Belgian bufferstate is outdated. It is more likely to cause further trouble instead.

 gdb_germany.6.a:0"Time for discussion"
 gdb_germany.7.t:0"Secret arrangements"
 gdb_germany.7.d:0"Germany is not only interested in Eupen-Malmedy and the former Duchy of Limburg, but also in the sparsely populated border strip of East Frisia that is currently part of the Netherlands. With a mixture of pressure and benefits, we could make the Netherlands generously involved in the Congo and support their claims in Flanders, but only if they agree to our terms."
 gdb_germany.7.a:0"Pursue this plan, european holdings are the key."
 gdb_germany.7.b:0"We want the Congo for ourselves!"

 gdb_germany.14.t:0"Demand the southern territories!"
 gdb_germany.14.d:0"The claims to South Tyrol, Trentino, Slovenia and Istria are quite legitimate. With control of Istria, we could also regain access to the Mediterranean!"
 gdb_germany.14.a:0"Send the diplomats out!"
 gdb_germany.15.t:0"Partial succes!"
 gdb_germany.15.d:0"Yugoslavia caved in and agreed to return Slovenia. Italy, on the other hand, has partially rejected our claims, but proposes a trade!"
 gdb_germany.15.a:0"We will see what you have to offer!"
 gdb_germany.16.t:0"Italian proposal!"
 gdb_germany.16.d:0"Italy rules out the concession of italian south tyrol called Trentino! However, they are open to an exchange of the German-speaking part of South Tyrol for the Italian part of Switzerland. Moreover, a transfer of Istria will only take place if Germany refrains from any intervention or protest action in an Italian war and only if Italy receives perpetual march and troop movement rights through Istria."
 gdb_germany.16.a:0"An acceptable compromise"

 gdb_germany.17.d:0"Our diplomats are currently preparing an important conference that could repaint the map of eastern Europe once more.

 gdb_germany.18.a:0"Our new politics bear fruits!"
 gdb_germany.19.t:0"Rebirth of the Commonwealth"
 gdb_germany.19.d:0"We promised Poland our help. By returning Danzig, Poland now lacks direct access to the Baltic Sea. By reforming the Commonwealth, Poland could return to its former greatness. This is also the perfect chance to regain the Memelland."

 gdb_germany.20.t:0"Greater German Confederation"
 gdb_germany.20.d:0"It is time to deepen the relation between all German states even further and to consolidate them into a new system. It will take time to grow together and unify the different areas, laws and structures. It might be a long road but there will be light at the end of the tunnel.
