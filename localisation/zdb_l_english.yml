 powderkeg_belgium_desc:0 "We have concrete evidence that the Paris Commune is trying to start a Flemish-Walloon civil war to annex Belgium. We must resolve the Belgian question once and for all in order to forestall the Communists. If we do not act we could risk the entirety of Belgium falling to the communists."
 fire_is_spreading:0 "Pass on the torch"
 fire_is_spreading_desc:0 "The help we received from the Soviet Union was quite helpful at the time, but it could cost us dearly at a later point; we made way for communist influence to spread across Europe. And while the German communists might be on our side for now, we have to get rid of them sooner or later if we do not want to risk another 1918 Revolution. By using the recent developments in France, we could try to convince them to help their comrades in France and alleviate this problem."

 neuer_deutscher_bund_desc:0 "The first German Confederation existed between 1815 to 1866 and included the later German Empire, Austria and Bohemia.

By establishing deeper ties with all German states, we could form a second iteration, a Greater German Confederation to bring all Germans together in order to protect the heart of Europe from outside threats."
 former_lands:0 "Realpolitik"
 former_lands_desc:0 "We find ourselves in a strong position while the rest of Europe is still engulfed in the flames of revolution. With the Bolsheviks in the east and other Communists in the west, we should exploit our position of power by influencing the smaller states that are caught up in between. By doing so we will accomplish our goal of reclaiming the former territories of the once mighty Kaiserreich."
 invite_austria:0 "Accession of Austria"
 invite_austria_desc:0 "Austria has already expressed an interest in joining Germany after the dissolution of the Habsburg monarchy at the end of the First World War. Ever since then, there were aspirations to deepen our ties. Austria also played a major role in the first German Confederation, so it only natural for us to work together."

 former_lands_north:0"The Polish Eyesore"
 former_lands_north_desc:0"Ever since the harsh Treaty of Versailles, the map of Germany has been tainted by the polish corridor. Poland would never agree to return the lands of eastern Prussia back to us under normal circumstances. Luckily for us, Poland is looking desperately for an ally, but as long as this eyesore remains there can be no genuine cooperation between our nations. Fortunately, it is known that Poland has its own ambitions in the Baltics and in Slovakia. Maybe we can come to an agreement that would satisfy both nations."

 former_lands_south_desc:0"It is time to demand what is rightfully ours."
 protect_switzerland:0"Damage containment"
 protect_switzerland_desc:0"The French Civil War has already spread to Switzerland. The Italians are monitoring the developments very closely and already mass their troops along the border, ready to protect the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, should such a need arise. In the face of such threats, Switzerland has no choice but to accept our help if it does not wish two major powers to fight a proxy war within its borders. They have to accept their losses."
 hold_our_promise:0"Support Polish ambitions"
 hold_our_promise_desc:0"The return of Danzig left Poland without a direct access to the sea, and the docking rights and access to Vistula river were not enough to satisfy them. As a result, we promised Poland further concessions. The small state of Lithuania could be a solution that would be beneficial to us both: We could regain the Memelland and Poland could return to its former greatness as the Commonwealth."

 german_spirit_reborn:0"Rebuild the Nation"
 german_spirit_reborn_desc:0"Hitler's so called patriots had nothing better to do than to sabotage their own people when they knew that they had lost. Central and East Germany lie in ruins: bridges are broken and railways destroyed, and it will take some time to rebuild. Objects can easily be repaired, but it is the soul and spirit of Germany that will take the most time to heal."
 deutschlandlied:0"Des Deutschen Vaterland"
 deutschlandlied_desc:0"Hitler's doctrine has divided our nation. His vision for a greater Germany still prevails, but his ill-faded hatred against the Jews has tainted our legacy. We have to go back to our old values. As Ernst Moritz Arndt wrote 1813 in his famous song, everyone who speaks german is a part of our nation \"Soweit die deutsche Zunge klingt\", religion does not matter! Let's show this to the world by making it our anthem."

 zweiter_deutscher_bund_desc:0"The first iteration of the German Confederation existed between 1815 and 1866 as the successor to the dissolved Holy Roman Empire.

 stabilize_the_nation:0"Stabilize the Nation"
 stabilize_the_nation_desc:0"Everyone is still on high alert and people fear that our Junta wants to keep the power. We have to make sure that people feel safe again if we want things to go back to normal. For starters, we should guarantee the various rights the people enjoyed during the Republic, as well as elections for ministeries down the line. For now, Mackensen will take over the role of the Reichsverweser just like Hindenburg did."
 pass_on_the_torch:0"Pass on the Torch"
 pass_on_the_torch_desc:0"By accepting the help of the Soviets, their weapons and their volunteers, we have opened a doorway for them to Western Europe. The radical left in Germany has also used this time to organize and supply themselves. Thankfully, we have successfully infiltrated their operations. However, given their failure to slow down the civil war, they now lack a clear objective. We should give them one by planting dreams of a French Commune."
 abteilung_drei_b:0"Revive Abteilung III b"
 abteilung_drei_b_desc:0"Abteilung III b was the secret police of the Kaiserreich. It was not very well developed and almost irrelevant during the First World War. We should not make this mistake twice and learn from this mistake by properly rebuilding our agency. We should also start supplying our cells within the German-speaking parts of the French border region."
 ignite_the_spark:0 "Ignite the Spark"
 ignite_the_spark_desc:0 "We have assembled and equipped quite a large amount of willing Germans within the border region to form a militia. Some of our agents, as well as a large portion of the infiltrated communist network, are ready to incite local riots against the French government. We have also gathered enough compromising material that would link the operation to Moscow. All we need to do now is to ignite the spark."

 new_alliances:0"New Alliances"
 new_alliances_desc:0"Currently we stand alone, but we don't have to face the future alone. We should actively look for friends and allies. All of those who are courageous enough to join us will become part of the European Vanguard, for if we fall, everyone else will succumb to the red menace that spreads like a cancer all across Europe."
 germanic_expansion:0"Germanic Neighbours"

 swamp_germans:0"Swamp Germans"
 swamp_germans_desc:0"Frisian, Dutch, and Flandrian form the group that we playfully call Swamp Germans. They are very much like us, even though their German sounds like a drunk combination of English and German with a harsh dialect. We should celebrate our cultural connection and pursue common goals together."

 anglosaxons_desc:0"Our relations were not always tense. Our monarchs share history and blood; we were friends and foes over the years. In this time of danger and need, we must unite against our enemies. Together we shall rule land and sea."

 neue_verfassung:0"Bundesverfassung"
 neue_verfassung_desc:0"Now that it is clear who will lead the Bund, it is time to undertake further steps towards unification. At last, it is time for things to return to normality. Mackensen has served us well but he is a warrior and not a politician. We need a different kind of guidance now. Lets start this process by passing a new and modern constitution which will be valid for the entire Confederation."
 keep_adenauer:0"Kanzler"
 keep_adenauer_desc:0"The chancellor should become the most powerful person in the state. Bismarck, our cherished Iron Chancellor and founder of Germany has proved it. A constitutional monarchy is what we need; we can't risk the chance of having an incompetent monarch ruining our country. Having a qualified Kanzler eliminates that risk."
 new_kaiser:0"Kaiser"
 new_kaiser_desc:0"A semi-constitutional monarchy is the key. The position of the Kaiser should be the most powerful one, for he is more immune to outside interests and influence, due to his position and patriotism. However, it is yet unclear which royal bloodline shall take the throne. Though Mackensen clearly advocates for a return of the Hohenzollern Dynasty."
 free_vote:0"Free Suffrage"
 free_vote_desc:0"Everyone should be able to vote, no matter one's occupation or gender! Equal rights and equal opportunities for everyone! This will ease social tensions and mend rifts. This will also expose the benefits of a populace unhindered by age-old prejudices to the Bund. "
 limited_vote:0"Census Suffrage"
 limited_vote_desc:0"Our society can not afford to give a useless drunk the same voting rights as a well-deserved member of society. Everyone will receive 0-3 votes based on their tax contribution, 0-2 votes for their military and social service time, and 0-2 votes based on their educational degree! This way, we can make sure that every vote is earned, and that those who are qualified and can benefit our society are rewarded."

 the_polish_corridor_desc:0"Prussia has been torn apart as a result of the Treaty of Versailles. Before we can take any steps towards a friendly neighbour-like relationship with Poland, we have to address this issue and make Prussia whole again. Depending on how we conduct this reunification process, we might find new friends or foes."
 polish_cooperation:0"Eastern Cooperation"
 polish_cooperation_desc:0"After our peaceful reconciliation, both countries set their sphere of interest in the east. We made Poland a promise that we would not only give them access to the Vistula river but also help them reclaim lost lands where it mutually benefits us. And when the time is right, they will have their very own access to the Baltic Sea again."

 eastern_expansion:0"Eastern Europe"
 eastern_expansion_desc:0"We should not stop looking for allies just because they come from a different language group or culture. The east is currently a raw gem that just needs some polishing and guidance in order  for it to realize its true potential. There are some nations in particular that share our ambitions and want to challenge the cards they have been dealt with."
 approach_hungary:0"Approach Hungary"
 approach_hungary_desc:0"Hungary suffered terribly from the Treaty of Trianon. Seeing its lands taken away and its former pride stolen, they are keen at regaining their lost limbs.

 austrian_claims:0"Cisleithania"
 austrian_claims_desc:0"was the name of the Austrian lands of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. We should recognize those lands as parts of our close friend Austria before we can take steps in actually reclaiming them. However, we should limit them to the core lands in order to not disturb any more neighbours than necessary. This should greatly enhance our chance of success."
 approach_italy:0"Ease Austro-Italian Tensions"
 approach_italy_desc:0"The Austro-Italian relations have seen better days and have been lately scarred by wars. We should ease those tensions by recognizing Italy's claims on Dalmatia while relinquishing the Austrian claims on the Italian-dominated portions of South-Tyrol around Bozen/Bolzano."

 the_future_of_czechoslovakia_desc:0"Czechoslovakia is another weird construct that resulted from the humiliating peace deals of World War One. It is neither an ethnostate, nor a national state, nor a geographical solution; it was just a whimsical idea of the Entente powers. And now it is finally time to find a sustainable solution for the region."
 grossdeutscher_bund:0"Großdeutscher Bund"
 grossdeutscher_bund_desc:0"It is time to reform the Confederation into a federal entity which will be formally known as \"Großdeutscher Bund\" representing the ideals and borders of the 1848 proposed Greater German solution.

Hitler is the archenemy not only of Germany but of the world. When, in a few hours' time, I go before God to account for what I have done and left undone, I know I will be able to justify what I did in the struggle against Hitler.

Born 1892 to Wilhelm II as the seventh child and only girl, Victoria was the favorite of the late Kaiser. Before marrying the Prince of Hannover in 1913, she received the position of the 2nd head of regiment of the Danzig Hussars Cavalry. Given her background and history, she would be the perfect symbolic figure to kickstart our plans."

 gdb_germany.29.t:0 "Negotiations come to a halt"

Germany will regain Danzig and Posen while relinquishing all other claims on Poland. Poland will receive full access and docking rights along the Vistula river. Germany will fully compensate anyone living in the border region who chooses to leave the state. Furthermore they propose a mutual recognition of the 1793 borders. This would further solidify our claim on the Memelland and theirs on Lithuania and parts of Latvia."
 gdb_germany.30.a:0 "That's a high price tag, but it's a worthy outcome!"
 gdb_germany.30.b:0 "Still not good enough. That leaves us only one option..."
 gdb_germany.31.t:0 "Negotiations are over"
 gdb_germany.31.d:0 "The Poles did not like our aggressive stance and decided to abandon the conference. They want to call our bluff.

 gdb_germany.34.a:0 "We had no choice."
 gdb_germany.35.t:0 "Treaty of Danzig"
 gdb_germany.35.d:0 "After the resolution of the Polish Corridor question, both powers agreed upon further cooperation. Part of this agreement was the restoration of the 1793 border in the Baltics before the Second Partition of Poland. We now have the chance to follow through with those restoration plans. Shall we explore this matter further?"
 gdb_germany.35.a:0 "Put the squeeze on them."
 gdb_germany.35.b:0 "No! They are valuable buffer states."
 gdb_germany.36.t:0 "The Baltic response"
 gdb_germany.36.d:0 "Given their desperate and encircled situation between us and the Soviets, they opted for the lesser evil. Lithuania went along with the restoration of the Commonwealth. Poland held to its promise and returned the Memelland back to us."
 gdb_germany.36.a:0 "Our eastern borders are finally restored!"
 gdb_germany.37.t:0 "The Soviet response."
 gdb_germany.37.d:0 "Our actions in the Baltics did not go unnoticed. The Soviet Union exploited the situation, citing the protection of Russian citizens from the royalist resurgence."

All constituents have serious interests in the desolution of this artificial state.

 gdb_germany.39.t:0 "Results of the first week"
 gdb_germany.39.d:0 "All participants quickly secured their best claims.

 gdb_germany.39.a:0 "Easy pickings. Lets see what week two brings."
 gdb_germany.40.t:0 "Results of the second week"
 gdb_germany.40.d:0 "Thanks to our peaceful management of the German-Polish relationship and the friendly outcome of the Danzig exchange, we had a much better position during the talks. Poland does not press any further claims as it trusts our judgement. This enabled us to fully annex Bohemia and Moravia. Therefore, we were able to give the rest of Slovakia to Hungary, which will strengthen our bond while decreasing their ambitions."
 gdb_germany.40.a:0 "What a wonderful result. A toast to our new friends!"
 gdb_germany.41.t:0 "Results of the second week"
 gdb_germany.41.d:0 "Since we failed to resolve the Polish question successfully or peacefully, Poland made further talks horrible. They are constantly threatening to abandon the talks altogether and to involve the international bodies. The only way to achieve our goals would be to give them the remainder of slovakia. This would, however, sour our relations with Hungary by a great deal. If we do this, our chance to influence the balkans will be gone. We would also lose a potential alliance partner."
 gdb_germany.41.a:0 "Those territories are worth more than the entirety of the Balkans!"
 gdb_germany.41.b:0 "We need the Hungarians on our side! Forgo our claims in favor of the Hungarian ones!"
 gdb_germany.41.c:0 "Settle for the status quo. No one will get anything!"
 gdb_germany.42.t:0 "The Balkans are once more in motion"
 gdb_germany.42.d:0 "Given the general feeling of change caused by the recent treaties around Europe, the reawakened Hungary has teamed up with Poland to exploit the weakness of Romania. Internal struggles within the Romanian government has led their neighbours to press territorial claims accompanied by massing troops at their borders. Romania has decided to appease them during this time of national unrest."

It looks like they made secret deals with Bulgaria, as there are several reports of movements along the border and small skirmishes in Dobrudja."
 gdb_germany.43.a:0 "That's horrible!"
 gdb_germany.44.t:0 "Hungary mobilizes its troops."
 gdb_germany.44.d:0 "What started as a small daily Balkan business has turned into a race against time. The fights along the southern and eastern border have left the Hungarian borders undefended. Empowered by recent gains, the Hungarian high command decided to intervene and to occupy the remaining claims. It seems like Jingoism spreads like a wildfire..."

 gdb_germany.46.t:0 "Bulgaria asks for our help"

Finding some form of unity in this threat, the Romanian government-in-exile has decided to join Bulgaria, thereby forming the Balkan-Union. They now have to ask us for help. If we do not act now, we risk the Soviet Union gaining a dangerous amount of influence in the Balkans!"

 gdb_germany.46.b:0 "We won't risk another world war because something happens in the Balkans..."
 gdb_germany.47.t:0 "Another Balkan Conference"
 gdb_germany.47.d:0 "Given our strong presence and allies in the Balkans, we are able to heavily influence the outcome of this conference. The goal is to further unify the region into the Balkan-Union. We should take care of other territorial claims first though."
 gdb_germany.47.a:0 "Let's start with the obvious."
 gdb_germany.48.t:0 "The Breakup of Yugoslavia"
 gdb_germany.48.d:0 "The surrounding powers have agreed to partition parts of Yugoslavia to satisfy their territorial claims. Slovenia will be returned to the Deutscher Bund, Dalmatia will fall into the hands of Italy and the Banat region will once more be part of the Hungarian state."
 gdb_germany.48.a:0 "Excellent"

 gdb_germany.49.a:0 "Hopefully this brings peace to the Balkans."
 gdb_germany.50.t:0 "The final act"
 gdb_germany.50.d:0 "There is one last thing. Italy and the Balkan Union demand from each other to relinquish their remaining claims. The Union views Dalmatia and Albania still a central part of their region, but Italy wants those claims gone. In return, Italy now demands Montenegro. Although the Balkan-Union is our ally, we should consider taking the side of Italy; we do not want them to feel mutilated again."
 gdb_germany.50.a:0 "Support claims of the Balkan-Union."
 gdb_germany.50.b:0 "Support the claims of Italy."
 gdb_germany.51.t:0 "Unholy Alliance"
 gdb_germany.51.d:0 "Our recent actions have made Italy so desperate that they have reconsidered their stance. Given the overall situation in Europe, Mussolini decided that they should work together with the Communists to eliminate the Royalist threat across Europe. This would also bring them much closer to their strategic goal of completing North-East Africa as well as the Balkan Coastline."
 gdb_germany.51.a:0 "Scheiße"
 gdb_germany.52.t:0 "Mussolini Assassinated"
 gdb_germany.52.d:0 "Soon after the announcement of the Italian-Soviet partnership, lots of former supporters of Mussolini left his side. Some radicals even attempted an assassination attempt which severely injured Mussonlini. The doctors did their best but had to announce his death the following morning. Il duce è morto."
 gdb_germany.52.a:0 "That's what you get for dealing with the devil!"
 gdb_germany.53.t:0 "Italian Civil War"
 gdb_germany.53.d:0 "Following the turmoil caused by the death of Mussolini and the ensuing power vacuum, radical communists, supported by French and Soviets agents have proclaimed the Socialist Italian Union. Fascists elements have centered around Palermo in an attempt to free Italy of communist influence. We could use this situation to place Victor Emmanuel in charge. His popularity could receive lots of support and thereby unify the counter-communist elements. However, this will cost us valuable resources and might escalate the situation if the Soviet Union interferes as well!"
 gdb_germany.53.a:0 "Only muster troops for a protection mission in Istria!"
 gdb_germany.53.b:0 "We must interfere! Occupy the border regions and send those supplies immediately!!"
 gdb_germany.54.t:0 "Yugoslavian response"
 gdb_germany.54.d:0 "Under the joint pressure of the Deutscher Bund, Hungary and Italy, Yugoslavia agreed to return Slovenia to the Bund, Dalmatia to Italy and the Vojwodina and West-Banat to Hungary."
 gdb_germany.54.a:0 "Ausgezeichnet!"
 gdb_germany.55.t:0 "Italian ambitions"
 gdb_germany.55.d:0 "We received a secret message from Italy who wants to make us an offer. They know that we want to see Istria returned to the Bund. They want to make us an offer. They want to squeeze Yugoslavia even further, trying to obtain as much of the Balkans as they can. If we were to, let's say, look away, they would be willing to give us Istria in exchange."
 gdb_germany.55.a:0 "No. We don't need more Italian influence in the Balkans."
 gdb_germany.55.b:0 "That offer sounds fair. We don't have much to lose there, anyway."
 gdb_germany.56.t:0 "The end of Yugoslavia"
 gdb_germany.56.d:0 "Today, Italian and Hungarian troops have crossed the borders of former Yugoslavia after the Yugoslavs were pressured to accept further -protection- from Italy. Bosnia will become a part of Italy while Croatia will be returned to Hungary. The remainder will now once more be known as Serbia which is officially an independent state but de facto nothing more than an Italian puppet."
 gdb_germany.56.a:0 "Time for Italy to hold its end of the bargain!"
 gdb_germany.57.t:0 "The French Civil War Reaches Switzerland"
 gdb_germany.57.d:0 "Armed communists have occupied the French part of Switzerland and proclaimed their own communist republic as a part of the French Commune! If we act fast, we could secure the rest of the country. Otherwise, the fire might catch on."

 gdb_germany.58.t:0 "Troubling News"
 gdb_germany.58.d:0 "The recent civil wars have also rekindled tensions in Belgium. The surprising victory of the French Commune has led Wallonian nationalists to reconsider their chances, hoping for a French backup plan. Combined with other communist activities, this has created a very volatile cocktail."
 gdb_germany.58.a:0 "Keep an eye on the situation!"
 gdb_germany.59.t:0 "Riots in Belgium"
 gdb_germany.59.d:0 "A mix of Wallonian nationalist and communist sympathisers have gone out into the streets. Buildings are burning and fronts are forming. With the Belgian army safeguarding the French border, the situation is slowly getting out of control. There are already public calls for French support in a case of a larger revolt."
 gdb_germany.59.a:0 "Let's see what will happen."
 gdb_germany.60.t:0 "Dutch intervention"
 gdb_germany.60.d:0 "After the public announcement by popular figureheads of the French Commune stating that they would certainly back their brothers' call to arms should such a need arise, the government of the Netherlands showed her outrage. As a response, they have guaranteed to help the culturally close Flanders in any case."
 gdb_germany.60.a:0 "This is a powderkeg just waiting to explode."
 gdb_germany.61.t:0 "Request from Luxemburg"
 gdb_germany.61.d:0 "Today we received a plea for help from the government of Luxemburg. They fear that the French revolution might once more affect the small state. They fear a full-scale war between the French Commune and Wallonia against Flanders and the Netherlands. Given the unpredictable nature of communism and the possibility they could helplessly be dragged into a war, they have decided to choose a side. They place their future and hope into our hands"
 gdb_germany.61.a:0 "How could we turn our brothers away?"
 gdb_germany.62.t:0 "Palais de la Nation partially destroyed"
 gdb_germany.62.d:0 "Today some radicals stormed the Belgian Parliament in Brussels. It is unknown whether they had nationalist or communist intentions, since all attackers were killed during the ensuing firefight after they set fire to one of the eastern rooms. Firefighters rushed quickly to the scene but managed to only save about one-third of the building. Leopold III and the royal family fled to the Netherlands as a precaution. A war seems inevitable at this point."
 gdb_germany.62.a:0 "The Netherlands might have to follow through with her promise after all..."
 gdb_germany.63.t:0 "Invitation from the United Kingdom"
 gdb_germany.63.d:0 "The British are worried that such a conflict between France and the Netherlands could spell the end of the entire Netherlands. This would greatly disrupt their control of the English Channel and remove two important trade partners. Thus, they want our help during the conference to put enough outside pressure on both parties. This conference might look like a last ditch attempt to prevent a war, but, in reality, it is nothing more than an attempt to preserve their influence in Europe."
 gdb_germany.63.a:0 "We accept."
 gdb_germany.63.b:0 "We decline."
 gdb_germany.64.t:0 "The Netherlands back down"
 gdb_germany.64.d:0 "Multiple fights have broken out across Belgium. The French Commune stood by their word and joined the side of Wallonia. The help which Flanders was promised never came. With gaping holes in their frontline and a broken spirit, the remaining forces quickly surrendered. What was once Belgium is now a part of the French Commune."
 gdb_germany.64.a:0 "Dark days for Europe"
 gdb_germany.65.t:0 "The London Conference"
 gdb_germany.65.d:0 "The question of Belgium will be decided upon by the present powers of France, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. All acts of violence are strongly forbidden during the duration of the conference. France represents the interests of Wallonia while the Netherlands speak for Flanders. With that being said."
 gdb_germany.65.a:0 "Let's address the elephant in the room."
 gdb_germany.66.t:0 "First draft of the Treaty of London"
 gdb_germany.66.d:0 "The breakup of Belgium is inevitable at this point. All participants agreed upon that. Wallonia will therefore become a part of France while having increased levels of autonomy. Flanders will become an independent nation which will retain parts of the Congo. Burundi and Rwanda will be ceded to Great Britain while the north of the Congo will become a part of the French colonies. The small province of Eupen will be returned to Germany."
 gdb_germany.66.a:0 "Buffer states are outdated anyway."
 gdb_germany.67.t:0 "The Netherlands are not satisfied"
 gdb_germany.67.d:0 "The representatives of the Netherlands would rather opt for an reintegration of Flanders into the Netherlands which would be strongly rejected by the French Commune. In exchange for our support and that of the UK, they would give the Flandrian part of the Congo to the United Kingdom and cede the eastern parts of the Duchy of Limburg and the scarcely populated border strip of Frisia to us. If we agree to these terms, the French Commune probably won't listen to our mediation in the future."
 gdb_germany.67.a:0 "We agree upon these terms."
 gdb_germany.67.b:0 "We can't anger the French."
 gdb_germany.68.t:0 "Final Treaty of London"

 gdb_germany.70.d:0"Alsace-Lorraine was a German territory from 1871 to 1918 and has stayed German at its core. The breakout of the French Civil War has left the region mostly unimpacted as they have refused to pick a side. Local leaders have proposed that we use the situation to restore their position in the German sphere."
 gdb_germany.70.a:0"A most welcome suggestion. Willkommen zurück!"

Some of them were given old property from deceased civil war families, but we will have to settle the majority somewhere. We will also have to create entirely new settlements which will cost a lot. It was proposed to settle them within the scarcely populated eastern provinces and Königsberg where lots of the northern refugees landed.

 gdb_germany.110.t:0"Hunting Incident"
 gdb_germany.110.d:0"Yesterday afternoon, deadly shots were fired at our new monarch. A socialist sympathizer in the king's entourage suddenly opened fire as the Kaiser was collecting his hunting trophies. The assassin was shortly after apprehended but managed to commit suicide via some as yet unidentified substance. Meanwhile, the Kaiser was rushed to the next hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries. The normal succession would usually make his son the sole heir, but after a heartfelt speech by his wife, Victoria Louise, the public opinion swayed in her favor over her son who is seen as too young. Victoria Louise being the only Daughter of Wilhelm II would also greatly please those who would have liked to see another Hohenzollern taking the throne. As the succession laws are not yet finalized in the constitution, it is up to us as the regency council to appoint the new successor."

 gdb_germany.111.d:0"After the successful limited war campaign, our power projection increased quite a bit. No one doubts now that our army and strength has recovered. And so our territorial ambitions have not gone unnoticed by the Lithuanian government. Leading politicians sleep quite uneasy with the fact that they hold lands on which we have a claim and lay our eyes upon. And so the government has come to the conclusion that it must take proactive steps towards a peaceful solution. They propose a trade agreement: A large sum of money in exchange for the Memelland and the revocation of the Lithuanian claims to it."
