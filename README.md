GitHub Version of the mod "Großdeutscher Bund" - a mod for the game Hearts of Iron IV by Paradox Interactive

Short intro:
Großdeutscher Bund explores an alternative history where the Wehrmacht successfully opposes Hitler with the help of the Soviet Union and thereby opens the door for something that might be far more dangerous...

If you want to contribute to the mod then heres a little how to. I suggest to install Git and watch a video on how to use it.
Just download all the files here and move the GDB.mod one folder up into the level as the main GDB folder. Then open it with something like notepad++, visual studio code or any other compatible editor and make sure that the path matches the one on your machine. You should be able to launch the downloaded version afterwards from the regular game launcher.

For new features please open a branch and open a pull request once youre done so that I can merge the additions.

The repository is quite messy right now as this was not intended to be open to the public upon the initial conception. Some events are no longer used and lack commentary about their context. So if you go in there please just add a comment what it does.
